\section{Scope}
This document describes the AO simulation python modules in detail,
including their functions and behaviours and parameters required.  The
AO simulation software package, was designed for the AO simulation
project funded by the rolling grant.  

This document is relevant to anyone who is involved with the
development of the AO simulation software.  For an overview of the
simulation, please see \citet{overview}.


\subsection{Overview}
he AO simulation package contains modules which are used to simulate
the various parts of the operation of a telescope with an AO system
installed.  The scope of these modules ranges from creating
atmospheric turbulence to simulation of the closed loop telescope
system.  Each module is designed to perform a specific simulation
task, and are connected together by the user in such a way that
coherent results will be obtained from the simulation.

These modules communicate with each other by passing data, either with
in their process, using shared memory, or using MPI message passing.
The simulation framework has been designed so that this method of
message passing is transparent to the user.  Various base and utility
modules will allow the simulation to operate correctly.
