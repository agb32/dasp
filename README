AO simulation tree   ($Id: README,v 1.36 2009/09/07 17:04:12 ali Exp $)
==================
See at end for info about installation of all the required software...

Mostly python modules, some C (in cmod directory).  Examples in example
directory.

You will need to add the directory this file is in (the top-level aosim
directory) into your PYTHONPATH

e.g. if you are in the aosim top-level directory and running bash

export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:`pwd`


Colourized output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To get colour in your terminal, ensure the line 'self.colourized=...'
in util/Ctrl.py->class myStdout->def __init__ should not equal '-1' (which
prevents detection of colour, as this isn't foolproof) but instead '0'. 
The 'gnome-terminal' and Terminal.app do support colour correctly.


Platform build notes
====================

Linux
~~~~~
   General build
   -------------
   Type 'make -s' in the top-level directory.

Mac OS X 10.5 or greater
-------------

see the wiki,

   https://sharepoint.cfai.dur.ac.uk/Wiki/DASPOnMacOSX.aspx

Mac OS X 10.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Installation notes - note, these are old instructions, and may or may not work.  Installing everything from source (See below) is more likely to work.
   ------------------

   Python:
       If your installation of Python is NOT the Apple default but rather via
      Fink then you can attempt to install Python components using Fink. A
      manual procedure is detailed here as the author installed Python
      manually.

   Perl:
       There are requirements to use Perl, and if you need to install an
      additional module then the best way is to use the `cpan' script
      interface to CPAN. However, this uses a FTP interface so also install
      LWP (manually) and use the following command inside of cpan to get
      through the Durham firewall;

      o conf ftp_proxy http://wwwcache.dur.ac.uk:8080/
   
   GCC version problems: There are places where GCC 4.0 (the preferred Apple
   compiler) has problems and in preference 3.3 should be used. This can be
   achieved by issuing the command;

   sudo gcc_select 3.3

   which is permanant so you can return to 4.0 by changing the appropriate
   digits.

   One time setup:
   --------------
   (1) Set the variable 'MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET' to be '10.3'. Its a good idea
   to set this in your .profile script so you can ignore this instruction in
   future.

   (2) Open a port in the firewall (note, this allows any computer in Durham to
   control the simulation but this shouldn't be a problem as the
   naughty people lie outside our network.)

    1. Open 'System Preferences'
    2. Open 'Sharing' (under 'Internet & Network')
    3. Choose the 'Firewall' tab
    4. Click on the lock icon to allow editing
    5. Click 'New...'
    6. For Port, choose 'Other'
       TCP Port Number(s) is '9000-9001' (this allows two concurrent
        simulations)
       UDP Port Number(s) is blank
       Description is up to you! I wrote 'CfAI aosim'
    7. Click 'Ok' and the port will be opened.

   (3) Build and install FFTW 2.x and FFTW 3.x (both need to be installed twice)
      Do not use the 'fftwinstall.sh' script because it does not differentiate
      between Darwin and Linux.

    1. Obtain FFTW 2.1.5 from the website as a tarball
    2. Unpack and enter the new directory
    3. Configure using the following options;
      ./configure --enable-shared --enable-prefix --enable-float
    5. Build and check the process using 'make -s && make -s check'
    6. If all was OK then install using 'make -s install'
    7. Repeat 3-6 but remove the '--enable-float' option to configure.

    1. Obtain FFTW3 from the website as a tarball
    2. Unpack and enter the new directory
    3. Configure using the following options;
      ./configure --enable-shared --enable-fma --enable-float --enable-altivec
    4. Edit libbench2/Makefile and remove all references to getopt and getopt1,
       the following patch may help;
      
      168c168
      < can-do.c caset.c dotens2.c getopt-utils.c info.c      \
      ---
      > can-do.c caset.c dotens2.c getopt-utils.c getopt.c getopt1.c info.c   \
      185c185
      <       info.$(OBJEXT) \
      ---
      >       getopt.$(OBJEXT) getopt1.$(OBJEXT) info.$(OBJEXT) \
       
    5. Build and check the process using 'make -s && make -s check'
    6. If all was OK then install using 'make -s install'
    7. Repeat 3-8 but for configure use the following options;
      ./configure --enable-shared --enable-fma
   
   (4) Build and install GTK+ v2.0, and the Python bindings `pygtk'. The
       version tested here was 2.4.9-8 and installed via Fink by selecting
       'gtk+2' and related modules.  This also include `libglade'.
     
      Note: the version of libglade you use must correspond to the version of
      GTK you have installed i.e. for the details above, use libglade 2.x where
      x<=4.

      Note: the version of pygtk used must correspond to the version of GTK you
      have installed i.e. for the details above, use pygtk version 2.x and
      where x<=4.

      Note: for glade, you may require XML::Parser, a Perl module, in which
      case get it from CPAN or install by hand. Also requires is `scrollkeeper'

      Note: Ensure that libraries that pkg-config is compatible with (libglade,
      pygtk,gtk+) are either in the default pkg-config path or add them
      e.g. export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/:/usr/lib/pkgconfig/

      Note: You may have a problem with `libintl.h' not being found. Locate it
      (look in /sw/include or /usr/local/include typically) and then let the C
      compiler know the directory its in;
      e.g. export CLFAGS=-I/sw/include/

      1. Switch to GCC 3.3
      2. Tell pygtk where python is (if the interpreter isn't called `python');
      e.g. export PYTHON=`which python2.4`
      
      3. Configure the source tree. You need to know where the python source is
      installed, and you can use the `pypath.py' script to automate this;
      e.g. ./configure --prefix=`python2.4 pypath.py base`

      4. Then type 'make -s' and then 'sudo make -s install'
      5. Switch back to GCC 4.0

   (5) Build and install PyGIST.
      
      Note: Under Mac OS X it is recommended that you install the X11 version by issuing the
      following commands;

      python setup.py --x11 config
      python setup.py --x11 build
      python setup.py --x11 install

      The native Quartz version requires a framework Python (try typing `pythonw', if you get
      an interpreter prompt then this is your framework version but you must have used it for
      every installation to this point.)

      Run the `gistdemolow.py' program, if it appears to hang and the processor usage reaches 100%
      then you have suffered a problem which plauged this author. It was resolved by deleting all
      previous installations, selecting GCC 3.3 (see above in `Installation Notes') and using
      the commands listed above.

   General build
   -------------
   Type 'make -s' in the top level directory. Omit the '-s' flag to see the actual instructions
   being processed.

INSTALLATION OF SOFTWARE


#This is basically instructions on how to get a unix platform ready for the AO simulation.  Note, running this as a script may not work - instead, copy and paste commands one at a time to your shell.  Where wget is used, you should probably check that this points to the most recent version, by going to the website itself.  This needs to be run as root.
#For cray specific commands, see the wiki.
#Note, you may be better using your distros packages where available (apt-get or yum etc).  However for fftw, you'll need to compile the various options in...
#Note, for ubuntu, you'll need to do apt-get install build-essential
#to get the c libraries etc...

#numpy-1.0.2 - on ubuntu: apt-get install python-scipy

#scipy uses blas and lapack.  These are downloaded below.  However, if
#you are using AMD processor, you can use ACML, see instructions
#further down.  Scipy can be difficult to install.  You might be
#better off using pre-packaged files for your distro.  For example,
#for Fedora, you would use "yum install scipy*".  This will also
#install fftw, so before doing it, you should install fftw by hand
#using all the different configs (see below).

#Remember to add the following to bashrc... if it isn't there

#You can tell if SciPy found and could use your VARIATION libraries by taking a peek at the start of the inst.log file you created in that last step. Move through it via less inst.log and you'll see either FOUND or NOT AVAILABLE as it seeks each of the extra libraries.
#To test, import numpy and scipy and run scipy.test(level) where level is 1 to 10.

#Problems with scipy might be because of using gcc4.  In which case, I'm not sure what the solution is yet...
#If this fails, you could try using your package manager to install scipy.  eg for Fedora you would do yum install scipy*

#You may also need to install swig.
#Then checkout the aosim, cd to it, and type make.

#======================== Hamilton installation ===========================#

#Notes for installing on hamilton (ITS cluster):
#This is difficult but can be got right.
#Dont load any additional modules.
#First install blas, using g77 as the compiler.
#Then install cblas.  Copy the blas/cblas files to your library
#location as libblas.a, libf77blas.a (same file) and libcblas.a

#Then you need to install full lapack library.  However, for this, you
#need to adjust the defalt make.inc.  Note, the -O2 not O3.  I think
#this helps.

FORTRAN  = g77
OPTS     = -funroll-all-loops -O2 -fPIC -m64
DRVOPTS  = $(OPTS)
NOOPT    = -fPIC -m64
LOADER   = g77
LOADOPTS = -fPIC -m64
And also:
BLASLIB      = /data/hamilton/dph1agb/lib/libblas.a

then: cd src ; make ; cp ../lapack_LINUX.a /wherever/lib/liblapack.a
and to /wherever/lib/libflapack.a


WARNING: DONT USE ATLAS - ignore the next section.

Then, compile atlas:
cd ATLAS
mkdir build
cd build
../configure --prefix=/data/hamilton/dph1agb -Fa alg -fPIC --with-netlib-lapack=/home/hudson/staff/dph1agb/downloads/lapack-3.1.1/lapack_LINUX.a
make
make install
cd lib
make shared
make ptshared
cp *.a *.so /data/hamilton/dph1agb/lib
Note, that this configure creates a make.inc file - the values in here
were the ones used to create the make.inc file for lapack...



Then after this, install numpy:
Edit your site.cfg file to:

[DEFAULT]
src_dirs = /home/hudson/staff/dph1agb/downloads/BLAS:/home/hudson/staff/dph1agb/downloads/lapack-3.1.1
libraries = lapack,f77blas,cblas,gfortran
library_dirs=/data/hamilton/dph1agb/lib
include_dirs=/data/hamilton/dph1agb/include
search_static_first = true

This should then get numpy working and installed...

Scipy should then also install aswell.  Note, 0.6 currently works, but
the svn version doesn't.

scipy/numpy should be using f77 not gfortran.


Note, I did have a problem when using module fftw/gcc because this was
compiled with gcc v3, not v4.  So don't add fftw to your own module
environment - install it yourself instead.

Note, the numpy/scipy install doesn't work if you have any modules
loaded - so unload them before trying.

Also, can use (though this may not work):
python setup.py build --fcompiler=gnu95 build
for both numpy and scipy.  This means that it will build without
needing to edit the g77 -> gfortran in
numpy/distutils/fcompiler/gnu.py.

I think thats it - possible I've missed something though!




Scientific python (2.7.8):
Some changes are required to get it working with numpy
These are:
Src/MPI/compile.py:
Add after line with cfgDict = distutils.sysconfig.get_config_vars():
if "--numpy" in sys.argv:
    defines="-I/usr/local/lib/python2.4/site-packages/numpy/core/include -DNUMPY=1"
    
else:
    defines=""
cfgDoct["LIBS"]+=" -lufp" #(only on the cray...)
and then include defines at the end of cmd.

Use Scientific.N.package (=="NumPy" or "Numeric" to determine array
type).

File Include/Scientific/mpimodule.h - remove Numeric/ from the #include/
File Src/MPI/Scientific_mpi.c change PyArray_SBYTE to PyArray_BYTE

Scientific python 2.8:
python setup.py build
python setup.py install
cd Src/MPI
python compile.py
cp mpipython /usr/local/bin/

I think this does it - may need to to the PyArray_SBYTE to
PyArray_BYTE bit in Src./MPI/Scientific_mpi.c, not sure - testing...


To upgrade numpy on cray:
download numpy, scipy, blas and lapack.
Install numpy
Install blas (see above)
Before doing this, add -fPIC to make.inc in BLAS/.

For lapack, need to copy make.inc.example to make.inc add -O2 -fPIC to OPTS
and change gfortran to g77 and get rid of one of the gfortran options
(-fimplicit-none) and add -fPIC to LOADOPTS and to LOADER and to NOOPT.
Then several parts won't compile - just remove these from the
SRC/Makefile.  This is currently:
spstrf and spstf2.o in makefile after spotrs.o
dpstrf and dpstf2 after dpotrs.o
export BLAS and LAPACK as above.
cpstrf and cpstf2 after cpotrs.o
zpstrf and zpstf2 after zpotrs.o
In TESTING/LIN it fails.  But this doesn't matter.
Move lapack_LINUX.a to /usr/local/lib/liblapack.a and libflapack.a
Set up your BLAS and LAPACK environment variables.
Then do a python setup.py build for scipy.


Oct 2012 (ubuntu 12.04) (see below for a line to copy/paste):
python-scientific
mpichpython
mpich2
purge mpich2
openmpi-common
openmpi-bin
purge openmpi-bin
purge openmpi-common
mpich-bin
mpirun -np 2 /usr/bin/mpipython -c "import Scientific.MPI,os;print Scientific.MPI.world.duplicate().rank,os.environ.get('PYTHONPATH','pop')"
Should then print out:
0 your/python/path
1 your/python/path

If it doesn't print your python path, you may need to add it to /etc/environment

So, in summary, require:
sudo apt-get install python-scientific mpichpython mpich-bin python-netcdf python-dev fftw3-dev libatlas-dev gsl-bin libgsl0-dev libatlas-base-dev python-scipy nfs-common screen glade python-glade2 python-matplotlib


On fedora, need ScientificPython.
Then sudo ln -s /usr/lib64/openmpi/bin/mpirun /usr/bin/mpirun 
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib64/openmpi/lib/
Or - do 
module load openmpi-x86_64 (or module avail to see available, and then probably just module load mpi).
(put in ~/.modulerc for it to happen automatically - haven't got this to work - putting in .bashrc.)
On some fedora, you might get messages such as: librdmacm: Warning: couldn't read ABI version.
This isn't fatal - just means it doesn't find infiniband interface.  Can suppress using 
mpirun -np 2 -mca btl ^openib /usr/bin/mpipython -c "import Scientific.MPI,os;print Scientific.MPI.world.duplicate().rank,os.environ.get('PYTHONPATH','pop')"

check have all of:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib64/openmpi/lib/:/usr/lib64/atlas/:/opt/acml5.3.0/gfortran64_mp/lib


Also:
gsl-devel
fftw3-devel
atlas-devel
scipy

RHEL6: (atlas-devel not found)
Also openblas-devel  (for cblas.h - yum provides */cblas.h)
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/openblas/
ln -s libcblas.so.3 libcblas.so
ln -s libatlas.so.3 libatlas.so



acml-5.3.0.  
/etc/hosts (add gig44)

ssh keys - so can log into self.

Makesure /usr/local/bin/mpipython exists (not strictly necessary but
some of my scripts use it).  Soft link from /usr/bin/mpipython.

sudo mkdir /var/ali
sudo chown ali:ali /var/ali

alias mnt='sudo mount -t nfs gig44:/home/ali/aosim /home/ali/mnt'



Hamilton:
module load python
module load gsl/gcc
Note - module display ...
will show you the paths.

export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/local/Cluster-Apps/fftw/include/:/usr/local/Cluster-Apps/gsl/gcc/64/1.15/include
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/Cluster-Apps/fftw/lib/


Supermicro gpu:  /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf:  add blacklist mei
nongraphical boot:  Change GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"
to "text" in /etc/default/grub and then do sudo update-grub
Then all should be well!


Cuda on gig46:

 sudo apt-get purge cuda*
wget http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu1204/x86_64/cuda-repo-ubuntu1204_6.5-14_amd64.deb  (you get the link for the most recent
version from https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
sudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu1204_6.5-14_amd64.deb
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cuda
(restart required)
 The PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH were set in /etc/bash.bashrc, but they were
set to cuda-5.5, so I changed that to '/usr/local/cuda' which is a symbolic
link pointing to the most recently installed cuda version.

To test cuda/gpu:
cuda-install-samples-6.5.sh  <dir>
cd <dir>/NVIDIA_CUDA-6.5_Samples
make
executables placed in the bin directory.
