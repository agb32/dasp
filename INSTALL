Installation should be relatively straight forward.

First, get the packages you need, e.g.:
make ubuntu1404
etc.  If your particular distribution isn't in the Makefile, then install by hand, e.g.:

Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install  python-dev fftw3-dev libatlas-dev gsl-bin libgsl0-dev libatlas-base-dev python-scipy nfs-common screen glade python-glade2 python-matplotlib python-mpi4py libopenmpi-dev

Fedora:
yum install gsl-devel fftw3-devel atlas-devel scipy openmpi 

RHEL6:
Also need openblas-devel and:
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/openblas/
ln -s libcblas.so.3 libcblas.so
ln -s libatlas.so.3 libatlas.so



Secondly, check MPI is working:
mpirun -np 5 python -c "from mpi4py import MPI;comm=MPI.COMM_WORLD;import os;print comm.Get_rank(),os.environ.get('PYTHONPATH','pop'),os.environ.get('PATH','pop');"
Should then print out your python path 5 times.

If you are simulating a large system, you will also benefit from a BLAS library.  DASP can support mkl, acml, openblas or atlas.  Openblas is easiest to get going with.  ACML 6 isn't yet supported (uses OpenCL).
Install openblas in /opt/openblas and add /opt/openblas/lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH. 
(make openblas should do it)

Now make the simulation:
make

Export the suggested things, e.g.:
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/aosim
export PATH=$PATH:/home/ali/git/path/to/bin

For Fedora/redhat systems, you also need to:
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/aosim:/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/lib64
And may also need to add /usr/lib64/openmpi/lib
And ln -s /usr/lib64/openmpi/bin/mpirun /usr/bin/mpirun


Now, navigate to test/scao, and run:
python scao.py --iterations=200



DOCUMENTATION:
Is in doc/
To make it, navigate to the doc directory, and run "make".  You may need to install relevant packages - this can be done using:
make ubuntu1404 (and derivatives) - in the doc directory.

After installation, run daspbuilder.py to get started on your first simulation.
